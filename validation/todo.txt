TODO
----
Validation tests need their own testcase
Create a generic function that validate_schema/validate_syntax could inherit from? Wrap around?
Group validation functions in master checking class (MCC)
MCC has a feed_in method thats takes a file a time and validates it
MCC orders the validation methods as a serial process
Add/test new enum for uncategorized failure
Log uncategorized failures
validate_encoding - tests need to be reworked/resource dependencies fixed
