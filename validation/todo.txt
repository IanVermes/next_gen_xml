Generic validation tests needs to be checked against validate_syntax
validate_schema/validate_syntax should raise a special error if they dont get a pass or their desired error type. i.e. support for uncategorized failure.
Add/test new enum for uncategorized failure
Create a generic function that validate_schema/validate_syntax could inherit from? Wrap around?
Group validation functions in master checking class (MCC)
MCC has a feed_in method thats takes a file a time and validates it
MCC orders the validation methods as a serial process
Integrate checkschema.parse_xml into all functions that use etree.parse to support pathlib better
Refactor checkschema.parse_xml to use functools.lrucache
Log uncategorized failures
validate_encoding - tests need to be reworked/resource dependencies fixed
Validation result has error info object as attribute
Error info object has truthyness related to data completeness
Generate report from error. 
Generate improved report from error info object
Generate report falls back upon exception object instead of error info object if error obj is is false
